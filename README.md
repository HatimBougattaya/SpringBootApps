## TPIOC

This mini project represents a demo for the work we would have done without spring
autowiring and spring boot autoconfiguration


## Projet_Cinema

This project use a different approach than the Patients's mangement one by using 
Spring Data Rest or alternatively Rest Controller(new feature for Spring) which 
exonarate the app from the work related to generating views through standart 
controllers using models.

Instead with this approach we communicate with the FrontEnd side (using Angular)
through JSON objects generated by Spring Data Rest and Rest Controllers.
